# Privacy Policy for vsearch

**Effective Date:** 02/22/2025

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to vsearch! Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how vsearch handles your data and ensures your security while using our Chrome extension.

## 2. Data Collection and Usage

vsearch does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data to external servers. The extension requires users to input their API keys for OpenAI and Pinecone, which are stored locally on their device. These keys are used solely for making authenticated API requests on behalf of the user.

## 3. Data Storage and Security

- API keys entered into vsearch are stored locally on your device.
- vsearch does not transmit, share, or send API keys to any external servers.
- Since vsearch does not have a remote server, no data is collected or processed outside of your local environment.

## 4. Third-Party Services

vsearch interacts with third-party services, specifically OpenAI and Pinecone, based on the API keys provided by the user. These services have their own privacy policies, and users should review them to understand how their data is handled by those entities.

## 5. User Control

- Users can add, update, or delete their API keys at any time within the extension settings.
- Uninstalling the extension will remove all stored data from the userâ€™s device.

## 6. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the updated version within the extension listing on the Chrome Web Store. Continued use of vsearch after any modifications indicates your acceptance of the updated policy.
